This was a personal project I had originally done in tensorflow. 
I have since lost the original, am rewriting it in Pytorch.
The plan is to utilize Asyncio to train and display concurrent gameplay of multiple minesweeper sessions.
The model is based on a Reward system where the model is trying to figure out the game without any prior knowledge of minesweepers ruleset.
Will keep training it until I reach a satisfactory accuracy and then introduce model visualized thinking and game rules.
